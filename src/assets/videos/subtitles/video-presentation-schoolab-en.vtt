At Schoolab we create projects

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000 line:12 position:50% align:middle size:100%
to learn how to work differently.

Here in this unique environment

5
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000 line:12 position:50% align:middle size:100%
we house three distinct populations

6
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000 line:12 position:50% align:middle size:100%
students, startups, and large companies.

7
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000 line:12 position:50% align:middle size:100%
They coexist in the same place

8
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000 line:12 position:50% align:middle size:100%
which is a new space weâ€™ve recently inaugurated in Paris

9
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000 line:12 position:50% align:middle size:100%
over 1800 square meters on six levels

10
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000 line:12 position:50% align:middle size:100%
where we have around 400 residents, both permanent and temporary.

11
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000 line:12 position:50% align:middle size:100%
Not only do they work together but they create

12
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000 line:12 position:50% align:middle size:100%
the products and services of tomorrow.

13
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000 line:12 position:50% align:middle size:100%
What differentiates us from others that exist today

14
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000 line:12 position:50% align:middle size:100%
is the mobilization of an ecosystem,

15
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000 line:12 position:50% align:middle size:100%
comprised of a network of over 3000 people worldwide

16
00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000 line:12 position:50% align:middle size:100%
that we can call on for innovative projects and workshops.

17
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000 line:12 position:50% align:middle size:100%
The next step is the rest of France.

18
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000 line:12 position:50% align:middle size:100%
We know entrepreneurial talent exists not only in Paris

19
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000 line:12 position:50% align:middle size:100%
and in its top schools but also across France,

20
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000 line:12 position:50% align:middle size:100%
in different universities and anywhere creative energy is found.

21
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000 line:12 position:50% align:middle size:100%
We have strong ties with the USA in California

22
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000 line:12 position:50% align:middle size:100%
in partnership with Stanford and Berkeley as well as Singapore

23
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000 line:12 position:50% align:middle size:100%
to cultivate a unique ecosystem that will provide opportunities

24
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000 line:12 position:50% align:middle size:100%
and break down barriers to let people be more innovative and impactful.

25
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000 line:12 position:50% align:middle size:100%
